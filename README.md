## Acknowledgements
I am very thankful to [Sebastin Santy](http://sebastinsanty.com/) for providing the awesome [template](https://github.com/SebastinSanty/minimal-research-theme). The original template was further modified by [Arkil Patel](https://arkilpatel.github.io/), and then by [Ayush Agrawal](https://ayush1801.github.io/), whose source I obtained and modified to build my own website. I am thankful to all of them for providing their updates.

[Shikhar Sharma](https://github.com/Shikharhacks007) was very helpful in fixing a weird issue with Bootstrap, where contents from different cells were overlapping on screens of a certain size. The changes were a part of the commit id [518e00452e660e55c58145001da26dd325836ef4](https://github.com/LakshyAAAgrawal/lakshyaaagrawal.github.io/commit/518e00452e660e55c58145001da26dd325836ef4).

Thanks to [Sidd](https://github.com/Sidd-Dino) for pointing out a major flaw, there were some stray elements left as an artifact of refactoring.
